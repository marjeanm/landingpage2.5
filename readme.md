## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learned you have to set the width of the paragraph element to a specific px. Or when you generate the quote the added space will mess up css.
Also, you can set flexbox on the body to make sure everything is either in rows or columns to your specifications with out alot of guess work.
Also, i used Axios (npm) for the api fetch. I feel it works better for me, and javascript promises. it is a library that is good to work with and get familar with for client side node.js work.

This code centers the container, and makes sure the elements are stacked.

```css
body {
  background-color: hsl(218, 23%, 16%);
  font-family: 'Manrope';
  font-size: 18px;
  height: 94vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

This Css below sets up the quote body and sets a width on the quote body to stay put and not expand.

```css
#quote {
  font-weight: 800;
  margin: 0;
  text-align: center;
  width: 295px;
}
```

This is the axios code that i used to pull the api request. I like it becuase it is short and sweet,and not alot of lines of code.

```js
const digit = document.getElementById('digits');
const quote = document.getElementById('quote');
const generate = document.querySelector('.btn');
const adviceQuote = async () => {
  const res = await axios.get('https://api.adviceslip.com/advice');
  try {
    digit.textContent = res.data.slip.id;
    quote.textContent = `"${res.data.slip.advice}"`;
  } catch (e) {
    console.log('error', e);
  }
};
generate.addEventListener('click', adviceQuote);
```

### Continued development

Plans i have are to add a background changer, and a pop up greeting name and date.
